# unsplash-to-fb-page
a Python Flask app that downloads a photo from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) + posts it to a Facebook page

The app uses the [python-unsplash library](https://github.com/yakupadakli/python-unsplash)
and the [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/getting-started).

**Note:** this app is not functional as it sits in this repo. I have used this code to post images to Facebook. Their API likely will shift over time and may have changed in the past few years since I wrote this code.
